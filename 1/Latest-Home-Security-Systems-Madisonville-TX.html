They are so commonplace that the majority of us do not even see them any longer: the little shields or decals showing that a residential or commercial property is protected" by a home security system.

<p>Even though they tend to be more expensive than unmonitored systems, they do offer you comfort. That's because when your system is tripped, a signal will be sent out to the company by means of your phone line, alerting them that there's an intruder in your house. Within roughly 10 seconds you'll get a call from the security company (by means of the intercom system or your telephone), where you'll be asked to validate who you are by using a permission code.
