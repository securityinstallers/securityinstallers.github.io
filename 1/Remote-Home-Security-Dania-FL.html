<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
