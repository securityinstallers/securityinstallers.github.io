<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function.

HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
