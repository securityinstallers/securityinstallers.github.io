Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a personal guard. Numerous cities also require an authorization to even run a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>

<p>Noticeable and untidy wires stumbling upon walls and floorboards are an eyesore - despite the situation. Luckily, security system makers seem to have actually gotten this issue and addressed it through wireless security cameras.
