It has actually since been enhanced and now equals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home combination options. We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a limited field of view, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
