<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
<p>Motion detectors might not be worth the inconvenience if you have especially large animals. Your alarm company might end up owing a lot of false alarm fees, which they might then pass on to you.
