Also upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently gone through extensive background checks.
