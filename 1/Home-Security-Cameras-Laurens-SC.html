<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently gone through extensive background checks.
