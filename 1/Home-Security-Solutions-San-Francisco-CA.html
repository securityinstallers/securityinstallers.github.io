<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor.

Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
