<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
