<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
