<p>While every house owner stresses over break-ins, apprehension has actually surrounded home security systems due to their typically high expenses, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically resulting in false alarms. A few other companies (like Ring, Home, and Nest) have no-contract systems. But SimpliSafe has lower prices and more market experience, so it's still our favorite contract-free home security system. NOTE: We added in the cost of the SimpliCam, despite the fact that there's a special right now that provides you one for free. That brings the first-year total to $553.88. Be sure to search for offers like this, as SimpliSafe offers a free camera pretty regularly.</p>

Many emergency situations need immediate intervention, especially if you aren't home to hear the alarm. This is why we always suggest monitored alarm, especially for people who aren't home at all times.</p>
