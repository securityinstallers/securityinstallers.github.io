The loudest of the clever alarm we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at warning anybody in your house and those close-by that there's an issue. During screening, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we like that the sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adapted to represent animals, too. The alarm system is just one of two we evaluated that consists of an external siren, and we're impressed that it likewise features a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, even more preventing anyone from attempting to break in to your property.
