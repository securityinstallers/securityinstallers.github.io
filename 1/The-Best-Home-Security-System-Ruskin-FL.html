<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
