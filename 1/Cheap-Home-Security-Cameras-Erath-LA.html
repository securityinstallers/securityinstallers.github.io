<p>The disadvantage? It's very easy to commit security errors that will leave your home susceptible. The minute you drive out of signal range or turn your phone to aircraft mode is the moment you've left your house open. This gaping hole in your security can show to be a big problem if you aren't careful. With a monitored system, that wouldn't be a concern. However, with an unmonitored system, it's up to you to get in touch with the authorities or other emergency situation services if your home is in threat.

<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>

Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year agreement, but since Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a big dedication. So choose what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the contract and reap those cost savings if you know you'll remain put for at least 3 years. But if you might upgrade to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
