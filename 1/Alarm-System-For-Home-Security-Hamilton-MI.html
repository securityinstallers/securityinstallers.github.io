This look is recognizable to nearly everyone and therefore serves as a deterrent to unwanted people. If security cameras are visible, the hope is intruders and lawbreakers go in other places rather. That being stated, bullet cameras are more vulnerable to vandalism because of their apparent appearance. In addition, the shape of the camera is perfect for concentrating on a set field, such as an entry or exit, but requires several cameras if a user needs to see numerous set views. Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work indoors or outdoors. They include a small lip on the end of the camera that adds weather protection and minimizes glare.</p>
