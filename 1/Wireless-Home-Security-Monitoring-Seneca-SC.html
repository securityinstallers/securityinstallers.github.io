<h4>Best House Alarm System Seneca 29678</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The manager reached 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further grievances, two weeks later on a new service technician was sent who showed there would be significant additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
