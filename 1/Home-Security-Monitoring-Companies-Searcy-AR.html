<h4>Security System With Monitor Searcy 72143</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager reached 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently gone through extensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following additional complaints, two weeks later a new specialist was sent who suggested there would be considerable service charges to complete the installation.</p>
