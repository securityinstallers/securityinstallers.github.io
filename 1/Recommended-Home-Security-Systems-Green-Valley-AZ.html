This camera offers a wide array of features consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I examined a Swann camera I described it as extremely middle of the road. Not excellent, not horrible, however with an actually easy setup process (and trust me, that actually is a killer feature when it comes to clever cameras.)

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
