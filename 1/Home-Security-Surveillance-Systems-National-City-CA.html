<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
