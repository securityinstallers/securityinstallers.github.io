This camera offers a variety of features consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I explained it as decidedly middle of the roadway.

You must consider a camera with an extremely broad field of view if you desire to see a large area. The capability to mechanically tilt the camera and pan is a terrific property as well.</p>
