<h4>Home Surveillance Security System Delray Beach 33445</h4>
<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, however you'll pay a little bit more if you wish to add extra features, like a security camera. While a typical contract runs 42 months (among the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to rent their equipment. Vivint has no minimum contract requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>Save money and time on installation with a wireless security system. Without the need to run video cables, wireless monitoring systems offer both flexibility and benefit. Not all coaxial cable needs to be utilized for CCTV camera installations. RG59 coax cable television is the industry requirement and best choice for CCTV systems and HD over coax systems.</p>
