No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
