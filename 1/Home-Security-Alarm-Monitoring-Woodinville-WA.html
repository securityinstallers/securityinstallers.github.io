<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
