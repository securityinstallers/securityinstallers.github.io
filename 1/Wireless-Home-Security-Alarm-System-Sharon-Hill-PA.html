<p>Pick camera positioning: Choose where indoor cameras will sit. The easiest placement is on a tabletop or shelf. Keep in mind, the majority of indoor cameras need to be plugged into a wall socket, which may limit where the camera sits.

<p>An NVR makes it easy to tape video surveillance footage, but you will need linked hard drives on which to store this video. Selecting the right amount of storage can look like a complicated gamble, but it doesn't need to be; it's merely a matter of computing the length of video you need to save, by the bitrate and resolution your camera shoots at. When taping 4k security camera video, this can end up being a large number needing terabytes of video. For lower archival requirements, you can generally get away with much less.</p>
