<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
