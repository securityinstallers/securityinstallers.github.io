<h4>Video Surveillance System New Market 21774</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following further grievances, 2 weeks later on a new professional was sent who showed there would be considerable additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
