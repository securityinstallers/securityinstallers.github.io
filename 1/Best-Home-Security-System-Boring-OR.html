<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be an effective security alternative (although we loved it as a family pet camera ).

We value that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a limited field of view, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, at least momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>

You simply plug it in and you're up and running.
