<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>

It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).
