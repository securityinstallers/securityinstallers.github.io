<p>The biggest problem with Arlo Pro 2 is that it's just a camera alarm system. You can install approximately 60 motion-sensor cameras around your house. As such, all the cameras also function as motion sensors Nevertheless, the package does not featured cheap motion sensors or entry sensing units that you can occupy around your house.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
