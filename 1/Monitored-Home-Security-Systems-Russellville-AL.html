<h4>Alarm System Security Russellville 35653</h4>
<p>Figure 1-1 illustrates an example of a CCTV installation that keeps track of choose locations of coverage. The very first installation was designed and developed for the separate parking center. This implementation included a number of set position cameras on each flooring of the parking lot, stairwells, and exits, all linked straight to a primary control unit (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is an easy device for handling the input and output of video feeds through the coax cable televisions.
