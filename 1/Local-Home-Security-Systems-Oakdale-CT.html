<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
