<p>What many people do not recognize is that there is another class of security camera that is directly available to the public, though not discovered in the huge box and discount store. These surveillance cameras are categorized as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the kind of camera utilized by these big box chains to secure their inventory. Take a look at the ceiling of customer electronics shops and warehouse chains and you will observe in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the typical customer camera. Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even utilize the type of cameras they are selling to the public, and there is a good reason.</p>
<p>Dome cameras are normally utilized for indoor surveillance, and are often mounted on ceilings. The camera's dome shape is developed to make it tough to tell which instructions the camera is facing. Dome cameras feature many optional functions. Some have infrared light for night vision, some have tamper-resistant features, and some have varifocal lenses, enabling operators to adjust the focal distance of the camera lens.</p>

<p>Justin was courteous and incredibly expert, offering us outstanding customer service. We upgraded to wireless security and he was extremely patient as he described how to include the app to our phones, and gave me an extremely well done individual training session on the details of the Safe Touch home page.
