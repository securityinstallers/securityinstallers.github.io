<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers realize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
