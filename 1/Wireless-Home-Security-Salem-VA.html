Also unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor reached 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following further grievances, two weeks later on a new professional was sent who suggested there would be significant additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
