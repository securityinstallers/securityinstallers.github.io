<h4>Digital Home Alarm Systems Liberty Hill 78642</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor got to 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently gone through thorough background checks.

Following more complaints, two weeks later on a new technician was sent who showed there would be substantial added fees to complete the installation.</p>
