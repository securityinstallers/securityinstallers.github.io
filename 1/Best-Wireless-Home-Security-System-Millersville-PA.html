<p>On the installation date, a single technician arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had recently gone through extensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following more problems, 2 weeks later a new professional was sent who indicated there would be significant added fees to complete the installation.</p>
