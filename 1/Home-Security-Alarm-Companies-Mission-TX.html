<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
