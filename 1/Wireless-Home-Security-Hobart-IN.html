<p>The House Smart Security Package, our previous runner-up, is still a strong choice for some individuals. Home has actually updated that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which provides a much better range for sensing units. Both the initial Home system and the Abode Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we checked that also deals with HomeKit.
