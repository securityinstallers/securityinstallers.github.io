<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. The loudest of the wise alarm systems we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at cautioning anybody in your house and those close-by that there's a problem. Throughout screening, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we love that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to represent pets, too. The alarm is just one of 2 we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're satisfied that it also features a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, even more discouraging anyone from trying to break in to your home. We checked Somfy's more pricey system, which came with a wifi security camera, however more budget friendly packages are also offered.
