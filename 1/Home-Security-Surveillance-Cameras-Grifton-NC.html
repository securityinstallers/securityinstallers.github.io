<p>Another factor to consider is security, a wireless connection is somewhat simple for hackers to access.

<p>Unlike standard alarm systems, which have a control board (generally located in the entrance hall) that is used to disarm the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensing units have actually been set off, clever alarms are controlled from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and informs you if any of the sensors have actually been set off, instead of getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially frustrating your neighbours).
