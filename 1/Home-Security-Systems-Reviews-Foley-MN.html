I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
