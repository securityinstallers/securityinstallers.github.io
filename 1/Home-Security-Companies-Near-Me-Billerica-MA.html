I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
