<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
