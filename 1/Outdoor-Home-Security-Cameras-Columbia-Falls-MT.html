<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Truly irritating. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, because apparently they car renew you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.
