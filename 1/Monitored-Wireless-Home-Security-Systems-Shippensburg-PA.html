<h3>Fantastic Spots to Install Hidden Home Security Cameras in Shippensburg</h3>
<p>Are alarms a effective and reliable  way to catch intruders?

Though Vivint's sensors are wireless, the control panel does need to be installed by a professional and linked  to a power source. It uses cellular technology to communicate with the monitoring center, so it examines both wireless" boxes, but remember that a professional will drill small holes to install the control board on your wall.</p>
<p>Typically, a basic installation will cost approximately $2 per square foot of your property. Monitoring charges are between $25 and $40 each month, with around $10 additional for intercom communication.
