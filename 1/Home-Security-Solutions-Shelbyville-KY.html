<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public spaces. When citizens are being enjoyed by the authorities - or conscious they may be seen at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things.

Eventually, he alerts, "people may learn to be mindful about the regulars and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, hookers or drug addicts." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people considered to be "out of time and location" with the environments went through prolonged surveillance.</p>
