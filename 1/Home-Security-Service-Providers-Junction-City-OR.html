<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some components may be impacted momentarily by a power failure, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical energy. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center in addition to a battery backup that can keep them up and running for numerous hours up until the electrical service is brought back. Landline systems use traditional phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, much like cellular systems, they normally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set period of time.</p>
