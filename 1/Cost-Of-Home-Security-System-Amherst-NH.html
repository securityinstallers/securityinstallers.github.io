<p>London has more than 10,000 CCTV cameras whirring away 24 hr a day. Providing customers the choice of a more full-service security offering, beyond offering alarms and other gadgets a la carte, makes good sense for a couple of factors. While pro monitoring expenses more, it's more secure. When something activates your alarm, your monitoring company will get the alert and then notify the authorities for you.

<p>If you do not require an entire security system, and instead just wish to watch on activity at your front door, then you might consider setting up a video doorbell to keep watch.
