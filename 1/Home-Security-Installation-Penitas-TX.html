The loudest of the clever alarm systems we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at warning anyone in your home and those close-by that there's an issue.

<p>Bullet cameras are one of the two most typical CCTV camera types. They have a long cylindrical shape, providing their name and an unique appearance.
