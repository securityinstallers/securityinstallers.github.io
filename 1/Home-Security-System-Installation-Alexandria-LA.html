<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store.
