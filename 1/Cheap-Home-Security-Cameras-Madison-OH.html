<p>On the installation date, a single specialist arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The manager came to 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently gone through thorough background checks.
