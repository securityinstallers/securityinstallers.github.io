<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras minimize criminal offense. There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving objects if it spots an intruder; a helpful intercom function that enables the gadget to act as a smart doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, considering that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>
<p>TP-Link's Kasa Web cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of view that might measure up to a few of our top picks. It also comes with 2 days of complimentary cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can cram in clips of up to 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips.</p>
