<p>With an analog system, coax cable is required for sending video footage from the CCTV security cameras.

Scotty Bach, a member of SPD's Significant Crimes Taskforce who focuses on home criminal offense, offers tons of expert understanding and advice-- like tidbits on the worth of home security videos and pointers for where to position your cameras, among other things.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. If recording video in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Arlo Pro 2 also has an excellent Night Vision function. It is geared up with infrared lenses that enable the camera to tape videos even in total darkness.
