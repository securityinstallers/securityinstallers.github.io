<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. If recording video in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
