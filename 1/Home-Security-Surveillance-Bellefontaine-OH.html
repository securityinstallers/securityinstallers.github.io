<p>Sensors are detectors constructed into the alarm system that send signals to the control board. Typical home security sensors consist of those designed for walls, garages, windows, and doors. Some window sensors now consist of glass break detection. Numerous security systems have crash-and-smash sensors, which sound an alarm when somebody (such as an intruder) attempts to damage or ruin the control board.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
