This look is identifiable to almost everybody and hence functions as a deterrent to undesirable people. If security cameras are visible, the hope is intruders and criminals go elsewhere instead.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
