<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
