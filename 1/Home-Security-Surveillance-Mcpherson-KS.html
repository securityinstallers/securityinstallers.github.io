<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, vandalism, and scams. And today's indoor security cameras deliver a lot more than tape-recorded video footage. Many feature the choice to view live action video, and cameras with two-way interaction let you sign in with kids after school, tell Rover to get off your favorite chair, or terrify the daytimes out of someone who doesn't belong in your house (plus you'll have their image, to boot!).</p>
<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is use any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, which camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
