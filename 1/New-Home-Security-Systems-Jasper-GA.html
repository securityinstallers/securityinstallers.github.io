<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
