<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
