<p>Unlike traditional burglar alarms, which have a control board (generally positioned in the entryway hall) that is utilized to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensing units have been triggered, smart alarms are managed from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensors have been activated, rather than getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially bothersome your neighbours). Nevertheless, smart alarms do require a center that allows the different components to wirelessly link. However for most smart alarms this hub can be put anywhere in your home.</p>
