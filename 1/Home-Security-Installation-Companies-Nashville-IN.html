I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
