<p>So, wired or wireless? Simply put, the type of security system that you need will depend on what you're trying to find.

<p>Likewise called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you precisely reroute the field of vision without remounting the security camera every time. They're excellent for storage facilities. A few of these may resemble dome cameras, but there's a basic trick to identify them - if the lens and the IR LEDs remain in front of the glass on the real estate instead of included behind it, you've got a turret camera rather of a dome.</p>
<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped casing that the camera beings in.
