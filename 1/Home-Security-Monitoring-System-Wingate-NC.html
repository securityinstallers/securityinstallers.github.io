<h3>Security Camera - Surveillance Camera Systems For Home And Office in Wingate NC 28174</h3>
<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

We think that's expensive.</p>
