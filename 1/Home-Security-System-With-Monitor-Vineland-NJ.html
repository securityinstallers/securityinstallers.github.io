<p>While it hits the resolution, we believe there's a little interpolation on its 4K footage given that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, but this is still far and away the sharpest security camera we have actually seen in action, wireless or otherwise.

Presume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
