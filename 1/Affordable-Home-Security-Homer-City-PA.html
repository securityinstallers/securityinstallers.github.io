A few models utilize batteries, making placement more versatile, but this needs other trade-offs, which we highlight in the Competitors area.

(For a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for The Majority Of People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good rule of thumb that if your mobile phone or laptop gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to mount the camera, you likely will not have a problem.</p>
