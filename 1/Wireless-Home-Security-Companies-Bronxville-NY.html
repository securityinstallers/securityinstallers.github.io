Rules are needed to establish a clear public understanding of such concerns as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and for how long are they retained; what the requirements are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the rules would be verified and enforced; and what penalties would use to violators.</p>

<p>iSmart also offers multiple camera alternatives. We've tested KEEP and SPOT (both iSmart cameras), and we're not a fan. However, they sell two other cameras we have actually not tested consisting of Spot+ and the iCamera KEEP Pro. Security alarm users have thirty days from the date of notice of an incorrect alarm to submit an appeal. Appeals must be in composing and include supporting documentation.</p>
<p>The most significant drawback of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets activated while you're away, you have no visual means of verifying if something is really incorrect and how serious the circumstance is. If the alarm event is figured out to be an incorrect alarm, the city will mail a billing summing up the incident and assessing a cost, if any.</p>
