<p>So we mounted the sensing units and set up a couple of security cameras, along with a video doorbell camera to see how well it secured our home. The outcomes weren't precisely glowing, but we believed the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras used crisp video, and the home automation-- well, there truly wasn't much in the automation department. Naturally, Ring is owned by Amazon, so it does work with Alexa. And you can incorporate some third-party devices into the system. But don't expect a fully equipped clever home.</p>
