False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they take place often enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
