<h4>Best Burglar Alarm Tennessee Colony 75861</h4>
<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>Customer care is Frontpoint's forte. While the company does not offer quite as numerous hours of customer support as other brand names, it has a fantastic reputation with great deals of vocal, happy customers. Some companies charge for service calls, others may not. Usually, a service call includes a journey charge and a hourly labor charge. Because they vary from company to company, customers have to talk to their alarm company to determine these prices.</p>
