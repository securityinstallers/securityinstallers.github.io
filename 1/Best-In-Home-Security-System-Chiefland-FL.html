I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
