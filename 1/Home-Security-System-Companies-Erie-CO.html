<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor reached 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following more grievances, two weeks later on a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be substantial additional charges to finish the installation.</p>
