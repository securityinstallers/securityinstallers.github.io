<p>The Wyze Cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be an effective security alternative (although we loved it as an animal web cam ). It has because been enhanced and now rivals our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and several smart-home integration options. We value that the company continues to iterate and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza.
