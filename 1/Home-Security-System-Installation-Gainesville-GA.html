<h3>5 Reasons To Install a Video Security Camera System In Your Home in Gainesville</h3>

<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager reached 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following additional problems, two weeks later a new professional was sent who showed there would be substantial added fees to finish the installation.</p>
