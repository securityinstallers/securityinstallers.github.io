<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
