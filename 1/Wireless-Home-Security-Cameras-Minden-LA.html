<p>B.

Numerous sensing unit security cameras are better for low-light or infrared (you can even target several cameras to the very same area and capture overlapping video feeds on various frequencies) and they're better for high resolution over fisheye lenses. Furthermore, in case of damage or obstruction to any single sensor, a. multi-sensor security camera will keep relaying where a fisheye or other single sensor camera would fail.</p>
<p>In short, the expansion of surveillance cameras has rapidly reduced our capability to maintain anonymity in public areas; and the advent of automated face recognition and other tracking technologies only accelerate this danger to privacy. For the most efficient alarm, conceal all wiring. A professional burglar looks for places where he or she can detach the security system.</p>
