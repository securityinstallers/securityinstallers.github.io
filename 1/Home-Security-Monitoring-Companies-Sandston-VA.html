<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
