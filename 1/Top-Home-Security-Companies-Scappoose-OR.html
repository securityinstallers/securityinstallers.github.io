Likewise disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error.

The supervisor came to 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually just recently gone through thorough background checks.
