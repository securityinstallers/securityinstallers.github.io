Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to disregard items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
