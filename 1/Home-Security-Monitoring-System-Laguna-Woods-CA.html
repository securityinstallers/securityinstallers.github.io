<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
