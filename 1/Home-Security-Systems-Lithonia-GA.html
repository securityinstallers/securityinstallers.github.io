This camera offers a wide variety of functions including a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as extremely middle of the road.

This newer version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
<p>When you pick one of the very best home security systems on the marketplace, you get comfort knowing that home and everything in it is protected.
