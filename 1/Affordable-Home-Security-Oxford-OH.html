Hampton Products will introduce an indoor camera under its Selection by Hampton line in spring 2020. The wire-free camera has a 130-degree viewing and a rechargeable battery angle.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
