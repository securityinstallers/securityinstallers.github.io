<p>Houston home alarm companies that offer totally free" alarm systems are just hiding the equipment cost in your 3-5-year agreement. That equipment is paid for within the very first year, but do they decrease your rate once it's paid off? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 month-to-month rate for a minimum of another 2+ years. That forces you to significantly pay too much. Besides paying too much, what if their service is bad? Too bad, you're caught in their agreement.</p>
