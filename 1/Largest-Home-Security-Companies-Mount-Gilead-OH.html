<h3>The Advancement of Security Technology with Network Security in Mount Gilead</h3>
<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light capabilities have a shutter that enables more light to get in the camera's sensing unit.

To fight this fuzzy image some security cameras come geared up with 2D and 3D digital noise reduction Some security cameras now come with infrared light that is unnoticeable to the human eye but can be picked up by a security camera's sensor.</p>
