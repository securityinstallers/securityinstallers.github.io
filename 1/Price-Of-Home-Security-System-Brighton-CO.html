It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion.
