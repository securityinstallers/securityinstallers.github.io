<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor reached 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following additional grievances, two weeks later a new professional was sent who showed there would be considerable surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
