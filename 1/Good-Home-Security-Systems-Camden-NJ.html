<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
