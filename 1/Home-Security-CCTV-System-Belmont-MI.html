<h4>Home Window Security Belmont 49306</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently been subjected to extensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following further complaints, 2 weeks later a new service technician was sent who showed there would be considerable surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
