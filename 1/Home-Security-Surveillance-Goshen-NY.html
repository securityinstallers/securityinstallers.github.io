However, those functions come at a relatively steep cost: $5 per month ($50 per year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 per year) for 1 month of video history.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
