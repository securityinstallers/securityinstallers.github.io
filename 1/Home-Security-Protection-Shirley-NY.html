Not excellent, not dreadful, but with a really simple setup procedure (and trust me, that actually is a killer function when it pertains to smart cameras.) This newer variation is similar, to be frank.</p>

<h2>Home Security System Service in Shirley New York</h2>
<p>Simply bought and set up all cameras. It is working for now. Nevertheless, I had problems throughout the setup as only 1 camera was able to pickup the signal. It took me a while to figure out how to manually add the other cameras. A lot of wise cameras can be programmed to do things like this, however few make things as simple as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives easier and Hive's ecosystem measures up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it's difficult to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's much better than a lot of cameras that are four times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

We've seen it highlight mice, automobiles, and moths.</p>
