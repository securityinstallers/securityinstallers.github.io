<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
