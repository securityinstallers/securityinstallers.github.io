<p>On the installation date, a single technician arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The manager came to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had recently undergone comprehensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following additional problems, 2 weeks later on a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be considerable added fees to complete the installation.</p>
