I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>

Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security guard. Several cities likewise require a permit to even own and run a home security system.
