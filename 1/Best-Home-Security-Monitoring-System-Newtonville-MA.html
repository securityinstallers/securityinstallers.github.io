<h4>Outside Security Cameras Newtonville 02460</h4>
<p>The Residence Smart Security Package, our previous runner-up, is still a strong option for some people. Abode has updated that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which provides a much better variety for sensing units. Both the original Abode system and the Abode Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we tested that also works with HomeKit.
