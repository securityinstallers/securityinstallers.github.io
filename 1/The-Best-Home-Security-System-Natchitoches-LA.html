<p>All About Security provides professional, dependable alarm monitoring services for homes and services throughout the greater Indianapolis area. Since it's more complex than it should be, we don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Outdoor Camera - This weatherproof camera provides smooth security video with a mix of tough wiring and WiFi. It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send out voice warnings through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you focus on the action.

<h2>Affordable Home Security Systems in Natchitoches Louisiana</h2>

You no longer need reams of cable, a bank of screens, or a substantial disk drive to store all the video, because everything can be established in minutes and handled from your phone. We enjoy that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision alternative, but the black and white version can in fact be clearer and offer you higher-quality video footage. This isn't actually a big deal considering the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- however for the record, stick to white and black.</p>
<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the limited series of sensing units. A lot of radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet.
