We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll require numerous Minuts throughout your property, which can get pricey. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
