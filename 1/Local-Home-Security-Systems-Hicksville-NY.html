<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
