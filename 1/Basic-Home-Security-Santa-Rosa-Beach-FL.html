<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the exact very same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
