<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
