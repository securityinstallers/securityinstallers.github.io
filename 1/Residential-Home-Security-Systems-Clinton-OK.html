<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective offenders are less likely to dedicate crime if they believe they are being watched or have a greater risk of being apprehended. This is also called the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to offend can be lowered by modifying a range of systems such as increasing the threat of a culprit being nabbed, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, decreasing rewards from crime commission, and reducing provocations that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
