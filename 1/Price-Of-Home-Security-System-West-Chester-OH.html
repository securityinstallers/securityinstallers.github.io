That's where we come in, though - not just by putting these systems to the test at the CNET Smart Home but by evaluating the whole buying process and taking a close look at functions like two-way audio, motion detection, smart thermostats, night vision, contact sensors and even carbon monoxide gas detectors. We take a look at other important aspects, too - including the personal privacy concerns that feature filling your house with cloud-connected cameras and outdoor cameras.</p>
