<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
