<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
