<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to disregard things that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
