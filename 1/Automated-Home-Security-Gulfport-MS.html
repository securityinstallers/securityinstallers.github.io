<p>Bullet cameras are among the 2 most common CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, giving them their name and a distinctive appearance. This look is identifiable to almost everybody and therefore functions as a deterrent to unwanted people. If security cameras are visible, the hope is wrongdoers and trespassers go in other places rather. That being said, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism since of their obvious look. Furthermore, the shape of the camera is ideal for concentrating on a set field, such as an entry or exit, but needs multiple cameras if a user requires to see multiple fixed views.
