<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
