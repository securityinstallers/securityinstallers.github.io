Which security cameras are ideal for your system depends upon your individual needs and budget; are you putting them inside your home or outdoors? Is 1080P a large adequate resolution? Will they be able to see and record video efficiently in low-lighting? Are they positioned with appropriate field of view, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be essential? These are all important questions to be thought about when selecting security cameras for your CCTV system.</p>
<p>The prospective worth of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when private investigators determined the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sorting through video images captured by the city's cameras.
