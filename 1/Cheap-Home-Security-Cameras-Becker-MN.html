Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
