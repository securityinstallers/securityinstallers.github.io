The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>Motion sensors offer backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. But they just run when you're out of the house.

It would incorrect alarm every time you strolled into a protected space if the system worked any other method.</p>
