<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
