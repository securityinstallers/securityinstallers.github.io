<p>First and foremost, it's tough to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's much better than a great deal of cameras that are 4 times the cost.

<p>Aside from being home to nationwide security companies, Seattle is home to local yet ingenious companies. We picked 2 local home alarm companies in Seattle to compare to the nationwide companies: Protective Systems Inc., and Absolute Security Alarms. Image resolution: Most outdoor cameras stream 1080p video. If a camera does only 720p, you shouldn't be paying more than $100.</p>

<p>There are 2 outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped.

On the other hand, bullet-shaped cameras are more typical. They have a cylinder shape that clearly sticks out to alert thieves that your home is under surveillance.</p>
