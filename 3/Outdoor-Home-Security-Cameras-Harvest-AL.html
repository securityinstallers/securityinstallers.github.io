<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. The loudest of the smart alarm we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at alerting anybody in your house and those close-by that there's a problem. During screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we love that the sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adjusted to represent animals, too. The alarm system is just one of two we evaluated that includes an external siren, and we're amazed that it likewise comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further discouraging anybody from attempting to break in to your home.
