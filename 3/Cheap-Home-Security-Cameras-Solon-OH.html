Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The manager got to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had just recently gone through extensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following additional problems, 2 weeks later on a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be significant added fees to finish the installation.</p>
