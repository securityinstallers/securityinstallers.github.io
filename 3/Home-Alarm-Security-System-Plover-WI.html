<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If catching footage in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader area and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
