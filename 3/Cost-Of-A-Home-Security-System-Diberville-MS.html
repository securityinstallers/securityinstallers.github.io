In theory the rubberised magnetic dish on the back, combined with a rough-textured metal ball installed on the wall, would be a exceptional and definitely adjustable  mount, however in practice it's slippery and the magnetic connection isn't quite strong enough to hold the weight of the camera and its internal battery in a fixed position.</p>

No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in total control of the equipment you use, as well as how and when you utilize and pay for monitoring services.</p>
