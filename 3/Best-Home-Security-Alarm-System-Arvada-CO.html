<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

<p>Advantages: low rate of incorrect alarms, extremely reliable sensing units, and high rate of detection. Lastly, if you don't have an outdoor outlet, installing the Nest Webcam Outdoor might be problematic. It features 25 feet of outdoor-rated cable, so positioning options may be limited. According to online reviews, the reaction time for Protect America is around 12 seconds, which is quite quickly. That puts the company in line with some of the top reaction times in the marketplace, together with SimpliSafe and Vivint.</p>

<p>The Abode Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a solid choice for some people. Abode has upgraded that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which provides a much better range for sensors. Both the original Residence system and the Residence Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we checked that also deals with HomeKit. We have actually come across a few technical issues while long-lasting testing the Abode Iota, and so will continue to check and update appropriately. We no longer recommend it.</p>
