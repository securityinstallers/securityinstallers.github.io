<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor got to 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had just recently gone through extensive background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further complaints, 2 weeks later a new professional was sent who suggested there would be significant added fees to finish the installation.</p>
