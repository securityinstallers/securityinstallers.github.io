I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
