The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
