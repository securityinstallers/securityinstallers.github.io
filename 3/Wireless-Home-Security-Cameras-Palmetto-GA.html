<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. An engaging argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe membership is that it includes person detection, which makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, in some cases, less incorrect signals. You will not have to fret about it taping or sending out an alert every time the dog walks by if the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic location. (We think this is a more valuable function if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where cars often pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's great that it's not necessary, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Camera.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
