<p>Different kinds of CCTV cameras. A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe membership is that it adds individual detection, that makes for smarter smartphone informs-- and, sometimes, less incorrect alerts. You will not have to stress about it recording or sending out an alert every time the pet dog strolls by if the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic area. (We think this is a more valuable function if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where automobiles frequently pass.)
