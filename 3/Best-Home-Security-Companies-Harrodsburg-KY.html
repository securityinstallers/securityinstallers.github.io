<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
