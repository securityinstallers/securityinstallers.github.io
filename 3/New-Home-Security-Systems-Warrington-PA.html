When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
