I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall.
