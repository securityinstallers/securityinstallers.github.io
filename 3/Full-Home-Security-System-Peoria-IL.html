I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
