<p>6 basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some elements might be impacted temporarily by a power interruption, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electricity. Cellular systems use cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours till the electrical service is restored. Landline systems use standard phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, just like cellular systems, they normally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set period of time.</p>
<p>In addition, gadgets that link through Wi-Fi, such as security cameras and clever door locks, can be hacked to gain access to your home network. An experienced hacker can then utilize your Wi-Fi devices and other network resources to perform Dispersed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks versus bigger networks. Possibly even more troubling is the concept of some stranger monitoring video from your outdoor and indoor security cameras.</p>

<p>London has more than 10,000 CCTV cameras whirring away 24 hr a day. Offering consumers the choice of a more full-service security offering, beyond selling alarms and other devices a la carte, makes sense for a couple of factors. While pro monitoring costs more, it's more secure. When something activates your alarm, your monitoring company will get the alert and after that inform the authorities for you.
