Likewise upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English.

<p>Security: There have been lots of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, baby screens, and other Wi-Fi gadgets to spy on people, so be sure to examine what steps has actually each manufacturer taken to remove this issue.
