Although theft remains one of the most regularly reported crimes, the clearance rate for U.S. thefts has actually remained listed below 15 percent for many years. 14 Clearly, whatever contribution burglar alarms are making to resolving theft cases is modest, at best. Though Vivint's sensing units are wireless, the control board does require to be set up by a expert and linked  to a power source.

The one time where lag does become a little a problem is between taping and discovering movement. It takes a 2nd for the camera to actually turn on when it spots motion because the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording. They could get past the camera prior to it had time to tape-record them if a dubious criminal was quickly enough.</p>
