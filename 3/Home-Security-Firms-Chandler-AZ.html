<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
