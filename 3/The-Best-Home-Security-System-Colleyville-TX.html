<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
