<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader area and for that reason provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example.

This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
