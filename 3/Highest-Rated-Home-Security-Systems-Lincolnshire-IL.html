<p>A social consensus about how cameras should be utilized is essential, however in the end we are a country of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the Fourth Change to the United States Constitution uses some protection versus video searches performed by the cops, there are presently no general, legally enforceable guidelines to restrict privacy intrusions and secure against abuse of CCTV systems. Rules are needed to establish a clear public understanding of such problems as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and how long are they maintained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the rules would be confirmed and implemented; and what punishments would use to violators.</p>
