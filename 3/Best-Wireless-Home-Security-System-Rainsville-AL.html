Multiple sensing unit security cameras are much better for infrared or low-light (you can even target a number of cameras to the very same area and capture overlapping video eats different frequencies) and they're much better for high resolution over fisheye lenses.

Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensing unit, smart lock, etc.), I wish to make sure that they all easily communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
