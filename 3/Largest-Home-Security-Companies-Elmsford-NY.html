<h4>Residential Security Cameras Elmsford 10523</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager got to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following more grievances, 2 weeks later a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be substantial surcharges to complete the installation.</p>

For somebody looking for a more complex setup like home automation, or someone that desires a trained specialist to make the suggestion for the setup, specialist installation is an excellent choice.
