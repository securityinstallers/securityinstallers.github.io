<p>Not all security cameras work in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that enables more light to enter the camera's sensor. The more light that is enabled to go into the camera the brighter the image will be. However, even these low light capable cameras have digital sound that make the dark image look fuzzy. To combat this fuzzy image some security cameras come equipped with 2D and 3D digital noise reduction Some security cameras now come with infrared light that is unnoticeable to the human eye but can be picked up by a security camera's sensor.</p>
<p>In spite of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can safeguard that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 winds up being more costly overall per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't recommend it considering that its battery-saving regimens can disrupt efficiency.</p>
