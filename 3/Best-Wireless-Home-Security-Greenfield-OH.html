<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
