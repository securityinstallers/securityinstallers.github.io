<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
