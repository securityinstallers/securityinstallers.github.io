<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras decrease criminal offense. There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving objects if it identifies an intruder; a helpful intercom function that permits the device to serve as a wise doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, since Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>
<p>The smart bit is that the camera not just identifies that people have entered its 130-degree visual field, but it will likewise have a stab at acknowledging them too. Perhaps more usefully, if someone passes who the camera does not know, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should automatically know.</p>
