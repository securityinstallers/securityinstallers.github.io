<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
