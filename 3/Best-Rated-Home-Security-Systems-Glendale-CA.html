<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
