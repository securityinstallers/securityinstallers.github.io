<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
