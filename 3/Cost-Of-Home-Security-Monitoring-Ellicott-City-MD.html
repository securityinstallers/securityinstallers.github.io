The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
