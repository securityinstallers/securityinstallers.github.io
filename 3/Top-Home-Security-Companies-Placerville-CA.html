<p>If an alarm goes off when you're away, this home Starter Set will just let you know that there's an emergency situation. If the motion sensors or entry sensing units have actually been activated, it will inform you. Nevertheless, there's no way for you to really see if there's a genuine concern for you to be fretted about. Is it a false alarm? Has the entry sensing unit just been tripped by a family pet or animal? Or do you have something to stress over?

I'm paying the lump amount, because obviously they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a problem, method too costly, and not great.</p>
