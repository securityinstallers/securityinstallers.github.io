These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
