<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The manager arrived at 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had actually not been completed. Following further problems, two weeks later a new technician was sent who showed there would be significant service charges to complete the installation.</p>
