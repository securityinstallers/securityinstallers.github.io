<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the whole household will enjoy. That enjoyable environment might be somewhat affected by the thought that you need to pay additional in order to use the camera's convenient night mode and some other helpful other bits of functionality.

<p>In other words, the proliferation of surveillance cameras has rapidly minimized our ability to maintain anonymity in public areas; and the development of automated face recognition and other tracking innovations only accelerate this threat to personal privacy.
