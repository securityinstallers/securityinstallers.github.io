<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Offered. The Canary Flex features a smart version that sends signals straight to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera uses a wide variety of functions consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as extremely middle of the roadway.
