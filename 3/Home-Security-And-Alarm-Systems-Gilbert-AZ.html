<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Offered. The Canary Flex features a smart version that sends signals straight to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera uses a wide variety of functions consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as extremely middle of the roadway.

This more recent version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
<p>When you select among the best home security systems on the market, you get peace of mind understanding that home and whatever in it is secured.
