I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
