<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients understand that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
