The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after nearly two years of day, use and night images have always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when testing the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
