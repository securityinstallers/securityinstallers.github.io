<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft.

The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
