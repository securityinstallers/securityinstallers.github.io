<h3>Security Camera Systems and Surveillance in Oliver Springs TN 37840</h3>
<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
