<h4>Wireless Security Company Carleton 48117</h4>
<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>Justin was incredibly expert and considerate, giving us outstanding customer support. We upgraded to wireless security and he was really patient as he described how to include the app to our phones, and provided me a very well done personal training session on the details of the Safe Touch home page. Now prepared to carry on with further installation of cameras. I suggest Safe Touch to anybody considering security for their home (or business).</p>
