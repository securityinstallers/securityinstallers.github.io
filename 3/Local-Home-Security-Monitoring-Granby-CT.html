<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a little an issue is in between recording and spotting motion. Due to the fact that the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording, it takes a second for the camera to really turn on when it identifies motion. They could get past the camera before it had time to record them if a dubious wrongdoer was quickly enough.</p>
<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera also works as a motion detector. It is equipped with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor, so whenever there's some motion detected, it can send you a push notification in your phone so you can react to it immediately. Additionally, the motion sensing unit here is much more sophisticated than the ones supplied by adobe Beginner Set. Considering that it is a PIR motion sensor, it just gets activated when it catches motion from something discharging infrared energy, i.e., individuals and animals. Furthermore, it doesn't get triggered by small things. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has one of the most sophisticated motion sensing units that remove all false alarms and just gets activated when people approach it.</p>
