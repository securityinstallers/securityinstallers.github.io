<h3>Security Camera Systems and Surveillance in Del Rio TX 78840</h3>

<p>Safeguard America offers low-cost home security with flexible monitoring options. However we're most impressed with their lifetime rate-lock and life time equipment guarantee. The basic mount and wall mount make it easy to setup at an angle to your taste - the 130-degree visual field assists - and there's the choice to eliminate it from the mount and utilize it wirelessly, albeit just for an hour.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
