<p>Everything about Security provides expert, reliable alarm monitoring services for homes and services throughout the greater Indianapolis area. We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it needs to be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
