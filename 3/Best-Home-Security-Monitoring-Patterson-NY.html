<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
