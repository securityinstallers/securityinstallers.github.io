<p>All About Security provides expert, trustworthy alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the greater Indianapolis area. The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>Siren A number of one-box systems like Canary and Somfy come with a very loud built-in siren that ought to hopefully frighten burglars (or next door's feline).
