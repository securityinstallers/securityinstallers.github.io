<p>All persons with alarm protecting a premise in the City of Fredericksburg must have a legitimate alarm permit. Last, we also think about just how much it costs to see, save and share tape-recorded video. While some cameras still let you see a couple of days of tape-recorded video, the trend has been to only let you enjoy live video from your camera unless you register for a membership. That implies you can't recall a couple of hours or days to see who was walking through your yard. And, most membership strategies also include extra features, such as custom motion zones.</p>
<p>Any balances owed the city for incorrect alarm costs must be paid by mail within 20 days following service.
