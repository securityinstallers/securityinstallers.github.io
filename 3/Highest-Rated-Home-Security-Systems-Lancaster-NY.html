<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Administrative hearing fines come from offenses of building, fire and hygienic codes, along with city tickets for such infractions as false burglar alarms.

Worries of terrorism and the availability of ever-cheaper cameras have sped up the trend even more.

Quick forward to today, and we're hard-pressed to discover a security system without HD CCTV camera innovation.</p>
