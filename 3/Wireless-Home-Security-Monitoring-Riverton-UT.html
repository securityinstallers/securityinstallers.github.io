We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of view, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, a minimum of momentarily (more on that in a minute).</p>

Alexa support is included, as you would anticipate from an Amazon-owned brand name, and the camera competently deals with all the usual functions when it comes to motion detection and two-way audio.
