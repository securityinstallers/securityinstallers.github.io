I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
