But I also appreciate minimalist systems that components that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation offered to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensing unit, smart lock, and so on), I want to make certain that they all easily communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
