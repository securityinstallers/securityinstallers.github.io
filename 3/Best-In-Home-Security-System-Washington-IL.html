<h3>What to Consider Before You Buy a Home Security System in Washington</h3>
<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a sensational value. It gets an Outstanding rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage. But the company does use a Total Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is detected. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>An NVR makes it easy to record video surveillance footage, but you will require connected hard drives on which to store this footage. Choosing the correct amount of storage can look like a confusing gamble, but it doesn't need to be; it's simply a matter of calculating the length of video you require to store, by the bitrate and resolution your camera contends. When recording 4k security camera video, this can end up being a large number requiring terabytes of video footage. For lesser archival needs, you can normally get away with much less.</p>
