We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, signals, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
