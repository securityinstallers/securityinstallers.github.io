<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>

Only those cameras that are designed to stand up to the aspects must be put on the outside of your house.</p>
