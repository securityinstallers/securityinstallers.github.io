<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
