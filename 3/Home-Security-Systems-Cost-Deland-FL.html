The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
