<h4>Surveillance Camera System Diamondhead 39525</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor got to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had just recently undergone comprehensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished.
