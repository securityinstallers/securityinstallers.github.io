<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
