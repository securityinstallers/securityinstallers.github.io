<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some components may be impacted for a little while by a power blackout, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical energy. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours up until the electrical service is brought back. Landline systems use traditional phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, just like cellular systems, they typically have a battery backup to keep them working for a set amount of time.</p>
<p>Video surveillance is cost scalable and effective. As your business grows, adding and incorporating extra cameras into a recognized network is cost-effective and simple. We're likewise a big fan of Ring's Neighbors app. This app lets you, your next-door neighbors, and police send alerts if there's trouble in the community. You can utilize it even without a Ring alarm, and if you have a Ring camera, you can submit and share clips of suspicious activity or lost family pets.</p>

Some models utilize your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the within your door, while others require that you eliminate your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
