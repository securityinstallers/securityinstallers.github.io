<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the agreement..

I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, because apparently they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.
