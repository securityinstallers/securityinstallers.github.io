<h4>Security Surveillance System Enfield 27823</h4>
<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights at night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>Blue cameras are compatible with Alexa and IFTTT just. Apple HomeKit compatibility coming soon to all Blue cameras. For too long, the wise home hasn't been really clever. It's made complex to set up and manage, with a lot of various devices that don't work well together. So we're streamlining things and bringing together all Nest and Google Home items under one roofing. Introducing Google Nest. Invite to the helpful home.</p>
<p>Its greatest issue is that clever cameras are coming down in rate a lot, and the Arlo system stays very superior. If you're not going to get into its more advanced features, it may be overkill - take a look at the other cameras in this list if your requirements are easier.
