<p>The Netatmo Welcome was quite ahead of its time as a security camera when it appeared several years ago, and it's still a really viable item. Like the other cameras here, it's a Wi-Fi-connected gadget that starts recording when it senses motion. Hampton Products will release an outdoor camera under its Array by Hampton line this spring.
