Many include the alternative to see live action video, and cameras with two-way communication let you sign in with kids after school, tell Rover to leave your preferred chair, or terrify the daylights out of someone who doesn't belong in your home (plus you'll have their picture, to boot!).</p>
<p>I described that all we would need to do is take advantage of any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system.

Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if required, could merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
