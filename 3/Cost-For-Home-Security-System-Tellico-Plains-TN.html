<p>As explained by Cornish and Clarke (2003 ), CCTV is a form of official surveillance," suggesting that not just does CCTV have the capability to take the place of cops or security officers but CCTV can also improve officers' abilities (Welsh and Farrington 2008). In addition to working as a deterrent, cameras can inform police of criminal offenses as they happen, which can enable officers to respond quickly and effectively (La Vigne et al. 2011). On a bigger scale, the use of CCTV also presents the possibility of assisting in the criminal justice system, as video footage of a crime might assist in examinations and prosecutions (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>
