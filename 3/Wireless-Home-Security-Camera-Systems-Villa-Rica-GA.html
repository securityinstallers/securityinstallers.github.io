I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night.
