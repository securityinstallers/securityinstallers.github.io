<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
