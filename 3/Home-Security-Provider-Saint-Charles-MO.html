<p>I don't see how these CCTV cameras will stop terrorism.

<p>Having pets implies you will require to consider their size, movements, and any other aspects that might trigger issues. For instance, if you have pets that are over 30 pounds, you will need a security system whose motion sensors can be changed or a system that can be set up in such a way that your big pets won't trigger false alarms to be sent each time your family pet relocations. If you have big family pets, you may want to consider avoiding the motion sensors and rely more on the window and door sensing units which aren't set off by movement but are triggered when a window or door is opened.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Monitors can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be established to communicate through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
