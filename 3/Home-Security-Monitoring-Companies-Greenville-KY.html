<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that admit to a home's security app to as much as 20 relative. However, shared monitoring isn't a feature readily available from all companies. If this is a high concern, make certain to investigate the company's features or consult with a representative directly.

Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
