<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
