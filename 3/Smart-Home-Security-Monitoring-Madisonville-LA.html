<p>Frontpoint provides 5 packages and 2 monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester selected the Interactive strategy however wound up dissatisfied with its absence of live video surveillance.

It turned out to be an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
