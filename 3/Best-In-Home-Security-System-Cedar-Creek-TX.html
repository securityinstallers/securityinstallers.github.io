<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the exact very same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm.
