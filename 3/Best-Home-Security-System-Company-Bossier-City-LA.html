<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some components might be impacted for a short while by a power failure, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical power. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours till the electrical service is restored. Landline systems use standard phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, much like cellular systems, they generally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>
<p>The City does not refund license costs to alarm-monitoring companies when subscribers cancel their service. Private alarm companies might have their own policies regarding refunds. The City is allowing customers to switch monitoring companies without charging the new monitoring company for a license cost that was paid within the calendar year by the previous monitoring company. Be prepared to provide your new company with the paperwork of previous payment.</p>
