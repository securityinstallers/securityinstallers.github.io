Likewise unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made an error.

The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had just recently gone through extensive background checks.
