<p>On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of wise home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't add a ton of other wise home tech to the system. It will not work with loads of wise home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely remarkable, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, creating 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or showing up the heat when you trip the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly cost for a set amount of time, normally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of devoting to a long-term plan, are becoming more common. These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract.
