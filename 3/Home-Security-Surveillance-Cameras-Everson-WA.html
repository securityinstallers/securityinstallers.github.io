<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion.
