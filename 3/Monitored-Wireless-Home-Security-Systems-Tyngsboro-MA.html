<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
