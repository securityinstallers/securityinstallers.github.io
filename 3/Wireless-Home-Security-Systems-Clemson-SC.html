<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone device or in tandem with the rest of your security system. When somebody sounds the doorbell, it triggers the doorbell camera. That video can go to your mobile phone, computer system, or to a screen inside your home. Doorbell cameras are part of many home automated systems and provide an additional layer of protection. These cameras often come with two-way talk, night vision, and an integrated motion sensor. As with any security camera, take a look at the video resolution and field of view.
