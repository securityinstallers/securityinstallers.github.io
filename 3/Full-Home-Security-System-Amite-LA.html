I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
