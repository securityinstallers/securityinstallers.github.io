The recorded digital video stream is then relayed over a local location network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be set up to interact by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
