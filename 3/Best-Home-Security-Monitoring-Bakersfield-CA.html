<p>Brand recognition has significant value when it comes to hindering possible break-ins. In reality, a study from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte Department of Criminal Justice & Criminology discovered that a security indication was more of a deterrent to intruders than outdoor lighting and a community watch. An ADT sign in your front backyard is a good bet if you would like to know you're protected (and want other people to understand it, too).</p>
