<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider area and for that reason uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
