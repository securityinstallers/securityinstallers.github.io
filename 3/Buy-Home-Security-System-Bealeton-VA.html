<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
