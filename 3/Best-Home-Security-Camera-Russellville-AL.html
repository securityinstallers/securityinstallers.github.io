This appearance is identifiable to almost everybody and thus acts as a deterrent to undesirable people. If security cameras show up, the hope is burglars and lawbreakers go elsewhere instead. That being said, bullet cameras are more vulnerable to vandalism since of their obvious appearance. Furthermore, the shape of the camera is ideal for concentrating on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, however needs multiple cameras if a user needs to see multiple fixed views.
