<h4>Best Alarm Security System Jackson 30233</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor came to 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had recently gone through thorough background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further problems, 2 weeks later a new technician was sent who showed there would be significant added fees to complete the installation.</p>

It turned out to be an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
