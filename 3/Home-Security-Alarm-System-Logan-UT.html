<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to interact, I was informed. The manager reached 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following more complaints, 2 weeks later on a new service technician was sent who showed there would be significant surcharges to complete the installation.</p>
