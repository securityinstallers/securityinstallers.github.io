<p>A tight wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.

We would advise considering a Do It Yourself home security system instead if you want to prevent having to sign a contract.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it because its battery-saving regimens can interrupt performance.</p>
