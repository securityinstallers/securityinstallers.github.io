<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical because the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
