<h4>Security Camera Equipment Pembroke 02359</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single service technician got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Also unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor got to 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently been subjected to extensive background checks.
