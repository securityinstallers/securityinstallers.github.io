<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
