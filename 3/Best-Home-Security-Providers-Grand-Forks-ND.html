<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. The loudest of the smart alarm we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at alerting anyone in your home and those close-by that there's a problem. During screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be gotten used to account for pets, too. The alarm is just one of two we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're satisfied that it also comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further discouraging anyone from attempting to break in to your property. We tested Somfy's more costly system, which included a wifi security camera, however more cost effective packages are also readily available. In spite of the substantial cost here, there's no external monitoring choice.</p>

We actually delighted in utilizing Brinks' video functions, and we like how their top-tier plan includes an HD video doorbell for good procedure.</p>
