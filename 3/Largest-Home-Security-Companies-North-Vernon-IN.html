I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
