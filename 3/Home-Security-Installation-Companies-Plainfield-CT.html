<p>I have had Alder Home Security just one issue, not with the GREET, but with the BEAM Alder Alarm wifi repeater. Itlast week went green, and would read as disconnected on the Zmodo app; nevertheless, it worked fine as a Alder Security repeater. I disconnectedit, reset it to factory default, and included it back to the Zmodo App. It is currently working fine. November 1, 2016Hands down for $80 you are not going to find a better doorbell system and Wi Fi extender. I began looking into wise doorbells after dealing with too many packages not being left entreprenuer CEO Adam Schanz by FedEx due to the fact that they wouldn't knock on the door and I reside in an upstairs system.</p>

You'll have to pay a monthly or yearly  cost if you 'd like to have continuous video recording and cloud storage for your security cameras.
