<h4>Security Systems For Business Roma 78584</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been agreed upon. Likewise disturbing was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor reached 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further complaints, 2 weeks later on a new technician was sent who indicated there would be significant added fees to complete the installation.</p>
