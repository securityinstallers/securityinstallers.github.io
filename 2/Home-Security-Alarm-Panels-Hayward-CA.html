<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
