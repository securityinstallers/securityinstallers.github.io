<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
