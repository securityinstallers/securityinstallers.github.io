<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
