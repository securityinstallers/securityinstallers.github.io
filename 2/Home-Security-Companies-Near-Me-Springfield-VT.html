<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
