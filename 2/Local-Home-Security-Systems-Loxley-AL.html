Now I explained this appeared like a stretch thinking about previous Sims video games had intruders, however my good friend mentioned the Sims 4 was produced a new generation, with a team of manufacturers surrounded by people OF that generation who would explain that the invasion of their home or safe location could produce feelings of discomfort or possible even triggering. Indirectly I can see his point, I've been playing games for a long period of time and a great deal of the things in earlier video games I have actually played a decade ago would definitely NEVER make it in todays politically charged video gaming environment.</p>
