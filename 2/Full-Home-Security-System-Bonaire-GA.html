Indirectly I can see his point, I've been playing video games for a long time and a great deal of the stuff in earlier games I've played a decade ago would certainly NEVER make it in todays politically charged video gaming environment.</p>

When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
