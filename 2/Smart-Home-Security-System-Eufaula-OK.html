<p>The Wyze Camera v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be an effective security choice (although we liked it as a family pet camera ). It has since been improved and now rivals our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home combination alternatives. We value that the company continues to repeat and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of vision, and Wyze says it prepares to do away with individual detection, a minimum of temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
