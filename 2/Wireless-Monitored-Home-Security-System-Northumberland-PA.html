<p>All About Security supplies professional, dependable alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the greater Indianapolis location. We don't advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
