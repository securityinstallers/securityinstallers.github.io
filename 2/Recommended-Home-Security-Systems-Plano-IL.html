<p>On the installation date, a single specialist got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Also upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor got to 10:30 with two other males who spoke little English. In action to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the males left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following additional complaints, 2 weeks later a new professional was sent who suggested there would be considerable additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
