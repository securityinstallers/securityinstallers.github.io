Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to overlook objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
