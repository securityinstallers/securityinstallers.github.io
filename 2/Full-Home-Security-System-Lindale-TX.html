<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. As for how to use one, they work the like many other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup. In some cases you don't even need to hardwire them, depending upon which design you select. While people typically presume wireless security is less safe than to wired systems, industry veterans understand that this is far from the truth.</p>
<p>I explained that all we would require to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, which camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
