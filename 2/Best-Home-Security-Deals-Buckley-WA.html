<p>Just transferred to Los Angeles and I think I'm going to buy a home security system for the very first time.

<p>A wise lock is normally part of a robust smart home security setup, but you do not have to invest in a full-blown system to use one. If you're using a home automation hub to manage things like lighting and thermostats, you can include a Z-Wave or Zigbee clever lock to the system without much effort. At the same time, if you don't have a home automation hub, search for a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that features its own mobile app. Smart locks use basic pre-drilled holes and are relatively easy to install. Some models use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and attach to the inside of your door, while others need that you remove your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
