<h3>Factors to Consider When Buying a Home Security Camera in Roanoke</h3>
<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal worth. It receives an Outstanding score for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for extra cloud storage. However the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is identified. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

Besides requiring longer wires for the cameras that I do not wish to purchase everything works good! Then this system is for you, if you are like me and normally set things up without instructions It has clear picture and easy to set up.</p>
