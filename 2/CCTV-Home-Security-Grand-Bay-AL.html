<p>On the installation date, a single service technician showed up remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently undergone extensive background checks. When the males left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following additional complaints, 2 weeks later a new service technician was sent who suggested there would be considerable added fees to finish the installation.</p>
