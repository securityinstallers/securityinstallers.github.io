<p>On the surface, these two camera classifications might appear comparable, though if you were able to see inside, the differences become distinct and obvious. Commercial-grade cameras are created and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not an option; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is lots of available light, and as soon as the lighting ends up being absent or low (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
<h3>Arguments and Reasons For Using Video Surveillance in Lyons</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is a solid well-rounded camera that works inside or out, and it's very easy to install. The greatest drawback is the financial investment.
