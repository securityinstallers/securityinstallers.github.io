<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor reached 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In reaction to my issues, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually just recently been subjected to thorough background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following more problems, two weeks later on a new technician was sent who indicated there would be considerable additional charges to finish the installation.</p>

Because the system is more like a landline than a cellphone, the system is not able to connect to an app on your mobile phone.
