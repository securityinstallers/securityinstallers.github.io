<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>

An assistance window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might tell there was a problem with the circuit board. Definitely not perfect-- but the associate said sorry and shipped her replacement control panel overnight.</p>
