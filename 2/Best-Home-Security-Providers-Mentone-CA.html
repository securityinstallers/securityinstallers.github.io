<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
