<p>While every homeowner stresses over burglaries, skepticism has actually surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complex agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often leading to incorrect alarms. A couple of other companies (like House, ring, and nest) have no-contract systems. However SimpliSafe has lower prices and more industry experience, so it's still our favorite contract-free home security system.
