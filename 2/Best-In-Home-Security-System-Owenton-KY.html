<h4>Wireless Burglar Alarm Systems Owenton 40359</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A supervisor would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager reached 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently undergone thorough background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following additional complaints, two weeks later a new technician was sent who showed there would be significant additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
