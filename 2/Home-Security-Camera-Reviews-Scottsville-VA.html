<p>The Wyze Web cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security choice (although we loved it as a family pet camera ). It has since been improved and now matches our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and several smart-home combination options. We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other picks, it has a restricted field of vision, and Wyze says it prepares to do away with individual detection, at least temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>
