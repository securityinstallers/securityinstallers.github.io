The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to manually stop alerts (and recording, since it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting eight times over 2 months.</p>
<p>As a battery-operated technology, wireless security systems need to be checked regularly to prevent system interruptions.

Guidelines are required to establish a clear public understanding of such concerns as whether video signals are taped, under what conditions, and the length of time are they maintained; what the requirements are for access to archived video by other government firms, or by the public; how the rules would be verified and imposed; and what penalties would use to violators.</p>

Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it pertains to surveillance cameras, there are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
<p>How you handle the video surveillance systems can make or break your security efforts. The workflows, policies, and best practices you enforce collectively identify the efficiency of your system.
