<p>Due to the fact that clever home security doesn't simply have to have to do with keeping potential intruders away. Secret fobs, mobile phone GPS and even clever face-recognition software can help watch on the kids or a senior relative and let you understand when they get home safely, or if they leave your home suddenly. so state you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I recommend to have actually cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras.</p>

We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other choices, it has a minimal field of view, and Wyze states it prepares to do away with person detection, at least briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>
