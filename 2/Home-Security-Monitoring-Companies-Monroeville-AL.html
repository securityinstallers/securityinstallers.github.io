<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Offered. If you're looking for motion detection, the Canary Flex includes an intelligent version that sends signals directly to your phone. This camera offers a wide variety of functions including a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as distinctly middle of the roadway. Not fantastic, not dreadful, however with a really simple setup process (and trust me, that truly is a killer feature when it pertains to clever cameras.) This more recent version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
<p>Door and window sensors are contact motion sensing units that activate an alarm when the protected door or window opens. Like stand-alone motion detectors, these can activate when you're far from home or whenever you select. For example, you might keep the window sensing units always activated but shut off the door sensors when you're at home. These sensing units can work as part of your security system or by themselves, and they vary in size and style from tiny, streamlined sensors to bulky and apparent. Sensing units also differ in sensitivity. Some may set off when the door or window vibrates versus really opening.</p>
