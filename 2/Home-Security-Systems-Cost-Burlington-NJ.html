<h4>Intruder Alarm System Burlington 08016</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist arrived remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was told. The manager came to 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In response to my issues, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently gone through extensive background checks. When the guys left after 6 hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following further grievances, 2 weeks later on a new specialist was sent who showed there would be substantial additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
