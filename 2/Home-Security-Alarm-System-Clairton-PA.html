<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is necessary. In reality, we do not recommend purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Being able to distinguish between a cars and truck and an individual, for instance, allows you to cut down on unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a good perk, particularly if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the yard, a doorway, and even trash bin.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
