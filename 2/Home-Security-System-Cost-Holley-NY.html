<p>After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its pledge of up to one year of battery life.

We have actually observed some improvements given that the camera's launch, and will continue to upgrade this evaluation and check, as needed.</p>
<p>Whatever Vivint does, it succeeds. Where other alarm companies use a hodgepodge of third-party equipment, Vivint styles its own stuff.

<p>Security: There have actually been a lot of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, child displays, and other Wi-Fi gadgets to spy on people, so make certain to inspect what actions has each maker taken to eliminate this issue. Look for a camera that supports updated wireless security procedures, such as WPA2, and make sure it encrypts web transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other gadget on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
