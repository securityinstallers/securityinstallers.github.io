<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound modifications to the character of our public spaces. When people are being seen by the authorities - or mindful they might be seen at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "understanding that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You don't want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "individuals might discover to be mindful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang druggies, hookers or members." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals deemed to be "out of time and location" with the environments were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
