<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
