<p>This cool clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we found it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly setting off when motion was identified. We love that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It likewise had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service offered.</p>
