<p>Seeing angle: The camera's field of view determines just how much it can see. As you're most likely monitoring a single room, you want a large viewing angle. The majority of present cameras fall in the 130-degree variety. These wide angles can in some cases cause image distortion at the edges in the kind of a fisheye impact, particularly when used in smaller sized rooms, however it's not like you're going to utilize a security to catch snapshots for your picture album.</p>

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you desire the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the wise home tech.
