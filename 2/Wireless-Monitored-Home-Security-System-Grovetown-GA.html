<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
