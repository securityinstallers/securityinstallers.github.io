<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
<p>If you have the Arlo plugged in through its magnetic cable, you can configure detection hot zones, outside of which it'll ignore motion - useful if you live near a busy roadway, for instance, but the power requirement somewhat nullifies its otherwise wireless nature.
