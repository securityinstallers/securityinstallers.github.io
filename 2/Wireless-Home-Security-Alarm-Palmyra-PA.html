<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. The loudest of the wise alarm we evaluated, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at warning anybody in your house and those nearby that there's an issue. During testing, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we love that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to account for animals, too. The alarm system is simply one of 2 we evaluated that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it likewise comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further dissuading anyone from attempting to break in to your residential or commercial property. We checked Somfy's more expensive system, which featured a wifi security camera, however more economical sets are likewise available. Regardless of the substantial cost here, there's no external monitoring choice.</p>
