The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>

This will supply more accurate and less frequent notifies because many times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
