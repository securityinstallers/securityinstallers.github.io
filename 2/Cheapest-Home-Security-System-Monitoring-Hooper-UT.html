<h4>Dummy Security Camera Hooper 84315</h4>
<p>I have this camera connected to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
