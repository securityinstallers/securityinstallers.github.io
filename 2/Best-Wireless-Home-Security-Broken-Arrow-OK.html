<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
