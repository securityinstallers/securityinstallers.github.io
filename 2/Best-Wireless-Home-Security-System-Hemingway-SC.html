Today, you'll normally find wired security cameras that are powered over an Ethernet connection (PoE). Wired cameras may require drilling or professional assistance for installation.

<p>Analog security cameras transfer lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.

Compression methods are fairly complex and vary in their applications depending upon your requirements and hardware.
