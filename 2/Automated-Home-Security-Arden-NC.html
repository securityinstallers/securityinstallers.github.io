<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level.
