<h4>Security Alarm System Middletown 06457</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single technician got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was told. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had actually just recently gone through extensive background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed.
