<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
