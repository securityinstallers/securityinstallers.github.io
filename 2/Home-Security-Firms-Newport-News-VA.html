<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
