<h4>Wired Alarm System Downey 90242</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional arrived surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise upsetting was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The supervisor reached 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was ensured that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following additional complaints, two weeks later a new service technician was sent who indicated there would be considerable service charges to finish the installation.</p>
