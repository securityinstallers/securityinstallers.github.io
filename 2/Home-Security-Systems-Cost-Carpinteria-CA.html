<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
