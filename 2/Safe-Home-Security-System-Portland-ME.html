<p>There are two outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped. The dome-shaped outdoor security camera is understood to be less obvious to unwelcome visitors since they use a 360 swivel that makes it tough to identify their direction. On the other hand, bullet-shaped cameras are more typical. They have a cylinder shape that plainly sticks out to alert burglars that your home is under surveillance.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers understand that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
