<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
