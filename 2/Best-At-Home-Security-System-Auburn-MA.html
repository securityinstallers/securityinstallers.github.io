No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
