<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some elements might be impacted temporarily by a power outage, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electricity. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours until the electric service is brought back. Landline systems use standard phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, much like cellular systems, they generally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>

<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug.
