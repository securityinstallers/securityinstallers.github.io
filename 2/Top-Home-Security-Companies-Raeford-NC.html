<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some components might be affected for a little while by a power interruption, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical energy. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to interact with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours up until the electric service is brought back. Landline systems utilize conventional phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, just like cellular systems, they generally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set period of time.</p>

DVRs also require that the linked cameras remain in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to degrade.</p>
