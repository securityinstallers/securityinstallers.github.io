<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft.

The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall.

Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
