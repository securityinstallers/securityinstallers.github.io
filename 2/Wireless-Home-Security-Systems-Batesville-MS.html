<p>All About Security provides professional, trusted alarm monitoring services for homes and services throughout the greater Indianapolis area. Due to the fact that it's more complex than it ought to be, we do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

Your alarm company could wind up owing a great deal of false alarm costs, which they might then pass on to you.

<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a great security camera and an incredible worth. It receives an Exceptional rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage.

Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
