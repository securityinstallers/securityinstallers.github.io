<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
