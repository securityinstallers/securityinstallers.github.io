<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If recording video in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more accountable for false alarms, and decrease the number of unnecessary cops and fire actions. Alarm monitoring companies are the professionals and ought to be teaching their consumers how to correctly set and care for their alarm.

<p>Types of security systems differ, with lots of requiring a regular monthly charge for an alarm monitoring service.
