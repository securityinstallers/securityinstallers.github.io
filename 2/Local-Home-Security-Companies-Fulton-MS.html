<p>What many people do not realize is that there is another class of security camera that is directly offered to the general public, though not discovered in the big box and warehouse stores. These surveillance cameras are categorized as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the type of camera used by these big box chains to secure their stock. Take a look at the ceiling of customer electronics stores and warehouse chains and you will see in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the typical consumer camera.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

We have seen some enhancements because the camera's launch, and will continue to update this review and evaluate, as required.</p>
