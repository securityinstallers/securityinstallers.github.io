<p>The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for example. However, those features come at a relatively steep price: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for 30 days of video history.  For each additional camera, the membership is discounted to about half of the initial charge. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 per month for individual detection with one month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those functions and bumps storage approximately 31 days.</p>

All things considered, abode Beginner Package is one of the very best self monitored alarm for those who want a simple and bare-bones alarm system. However, the absence of a camera is a major oversight and they need to update their smart home integration systems.</p>
