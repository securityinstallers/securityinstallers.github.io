<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an offense. Once a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a priority.</p>

After he left, our tester discovered he was charged $190 more than his original quote. The new equipment was considerably more costly because it dealt with cellular signals instead of WiFi. We wish we had actually understood about that extra charge upfront.</p>
