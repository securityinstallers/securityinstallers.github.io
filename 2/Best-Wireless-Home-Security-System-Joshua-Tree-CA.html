<p>In spite of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its restricted, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug.

The alarm monitoring company will notify the authorities immediately if you do not react or you say that it wasn't a mishap.
