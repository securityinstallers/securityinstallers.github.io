I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
