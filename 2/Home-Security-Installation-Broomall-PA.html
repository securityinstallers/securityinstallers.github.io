<h4>The Best Security System Broomall 19008</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single professional showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- as opposed to the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Also unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor arrived at 10:30 with 2 other guys who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually recently been subjected to comprehensive background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had not been finished. Following additional problems, 2 weeks later a new service technician was sent who showed there would be substantial surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
