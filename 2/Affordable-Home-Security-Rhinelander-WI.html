Once a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

We want we had understood about that extra charge upfront.</p>
