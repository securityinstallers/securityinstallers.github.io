<p>At night, though it lacks the full IR LED selection of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good range, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're putting it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the wonderful motion detection.

Some models use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the inside of your door, while others need that you remove your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
