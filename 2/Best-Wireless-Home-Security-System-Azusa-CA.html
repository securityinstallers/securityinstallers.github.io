<p>No. Self-monitoring doesn't indicate DIY installation. There are many companies that offer self-monitoring and expert installation. Keep in mind there will be a one-time installation cost.

If agreement strategies don't interest you, think about Blue by ADT, which provides Do It Yourself installation and self-monitoring. Structure on what the Arlo Pro 2 deals, the Arlo Pro 3 deals QHD HDR video, full weatherproofing (so you can stick it outside), an impressive 160-degree viewing angle, and even colour night vision - so your low light shots will remain in colour rather than grainy black and white.</p>
