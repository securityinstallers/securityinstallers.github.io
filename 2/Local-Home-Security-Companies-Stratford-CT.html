<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera also serves as a motion detector. It is equipped with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensing unit, so whenever there's some motion discovered, it can send you a push alert in your phone so you can react to it immediately. Furthermore, the motion sensing unit here is far more sophisticated than the ones provided by adobe Beginner Package. Since it is a PIR motion sensor, it only gets activated when it catches motion from something giving off infrared energy, i.e., people and animals. Additionally, it does not get activated by small things. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has one of the most sophisticated motion sensing units that get rid of all incorrect alarms and only gets set off when individuals approach it.</p>
