I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
