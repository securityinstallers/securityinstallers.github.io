Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
