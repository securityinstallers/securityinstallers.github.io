<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
