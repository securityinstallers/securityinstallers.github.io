<h4>The Best Security System Hood River 97031</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist got here surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- rather than the 10 a.m.-noon window that had actually been concurred upon. Likewise disturbing was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his t-shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT immediately and the company acknowledged it had actually made an error. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager reached 10:30 with 2 other men who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was assured that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had just recently undergone thorough background checks. When the men left after 6 hours, the installation work still had actually not been finished. Following further grievances, two weeks later a new service technician was sent who showed there would be substantial additional charges to complete the installation.</p>
