Nevertheless, those functions come at a relatively steep rate: $5 monthly ($50 each year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 each year) for 30 days of video history.

If contract strategies don't attract you, consider Blue by ADT, which offers Do It Yourself installation and self-monitoring. Building on what the Arlo Pro 2 deals, the Arlo Pro 3 deals QHD HDR video, complete weatherproofing (so you can stick it outside), an outstanding 160-degree watching angle, and even colour night vision - so your low light shots will be in colour instead of grainy black and white.</p>
