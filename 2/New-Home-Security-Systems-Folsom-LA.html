No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
