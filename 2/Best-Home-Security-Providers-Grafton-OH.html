I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
