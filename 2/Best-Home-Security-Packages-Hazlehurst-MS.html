While some parts may be affected for a little while by a power failure, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical power. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to interact with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours until the electric service is restored. Landline systems use standard phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, much like cellular systems, they usually have a battery backup to keep them working for a set amount of time.</p>
