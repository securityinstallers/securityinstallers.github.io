I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also great metal building.

Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
