<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall.

These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.

If WiFi isn't an alternative, cellular connection is a good option. Ethernet cable televisions can connect a system as well, however that suggests cable televisions. Normally, a system with ethernet cables is expertly installed because the wires should go through the wall and tap into a home's electrical grid.</p>
