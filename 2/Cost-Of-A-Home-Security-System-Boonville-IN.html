<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 companies, universities, and federal government facilities, and residential consumers. Honeywell's Do It Yourself security system counts on a device called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top.

ADT Command offers you mobile access to your system and enables you to manage your lights, thermostat, and other home automation devices. ADT is the most popular security provider in the US, and ADT Command is its most popular package.</p>
