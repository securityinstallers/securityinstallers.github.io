<p>On the installation date, a single professional got here remarkably early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been concurred upon. Likewise unsettling was the fact that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was told. The supervisor reached 10:30 with two other guys who spoke little English. In action to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT employees, had recently gone through comprehensive background checks.
