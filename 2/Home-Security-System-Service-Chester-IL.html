<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
