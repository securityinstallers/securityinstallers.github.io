<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
