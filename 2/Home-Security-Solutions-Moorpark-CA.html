<p>Most security cameras can be utilized both inside and outdoors. They typically have the exact same features like night vision or remote watching, but they vary in sturdiness. Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and in some cases, completely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most long lasting. Because their design permits for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives. In regards to detection, it is better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection rather than motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will supply more precise and less frequent signals.</p>

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is extremely reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
