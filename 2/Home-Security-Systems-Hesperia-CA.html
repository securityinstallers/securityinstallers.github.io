<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
