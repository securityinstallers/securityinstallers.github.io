I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that apparently they vehicle restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, way too costly, and not fantastic.</p>
