<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the exact very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
