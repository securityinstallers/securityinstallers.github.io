<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening.
