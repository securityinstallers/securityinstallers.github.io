Also unsettling was the reality that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT instantly and the company acknowledged it had actually made a mistake. A supervisor would return later with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to interact, I was informed. The supervisor came to 10:30 with 2 other males who spoke little English. In response to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT workers, had actually recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the men left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following additional complaints, 2 weeks later a new service technician was sent who indicated there would be substantial surcharges to finish the installation.</p>
