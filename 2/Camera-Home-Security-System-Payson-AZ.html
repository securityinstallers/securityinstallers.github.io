<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
