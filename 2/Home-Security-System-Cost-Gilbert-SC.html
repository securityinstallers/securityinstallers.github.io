<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
