<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
