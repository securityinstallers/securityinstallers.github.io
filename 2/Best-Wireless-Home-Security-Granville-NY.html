<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
