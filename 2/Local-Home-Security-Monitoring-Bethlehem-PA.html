<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
