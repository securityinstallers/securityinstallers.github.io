<p>While every homeowner stresses over burglaries, apprehension has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often leading to false alarms. A couple of other companies (like Residence, nest, and ring) have no-contract systems. However SimpliSafe has lower prices and more industry experience, so it's still our favorite contract-free home security system. NOTE: We included the cost of the SimpliCam, although there's an unique today that gives you one free of charge. That brings the first-year overall to $553.88.
