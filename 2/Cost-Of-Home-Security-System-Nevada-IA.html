No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
