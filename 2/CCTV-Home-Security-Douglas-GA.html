<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
