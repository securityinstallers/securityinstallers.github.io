<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
