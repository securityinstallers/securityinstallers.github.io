<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions.

<p>The House Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a strong option for some individuals. Abode has actually updated that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which offers a much better variety for sensors. Both the original Residence system and the Residence Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we evaluated that likewise works with HomeKit. We've experienced a couple of technical problems while long-lasting testing the Home Iota, and so will continue to test and upgrade accordingly. We no longer recommend it.</p>
