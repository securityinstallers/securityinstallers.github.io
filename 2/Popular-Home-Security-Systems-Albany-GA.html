<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, uncertainty has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high expenses, complex contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in incorrect alarms. A few other companies (like Nest, ring, and residence) have no-contract systems. However SimpliSafe has lower prices and more industry experience, so it's still our favorite contract-free home security system. KEEP IN MIND: We included the cost of the SimpliCam, despite the fact that there's an unique today that offers you one for free. That brings the first-year overall to $553.88. Be sure to search for deals like this, as SimpliSafe offers a free camera pretty frequently.</p>

That said, some individuals just don't want that month-to-month professional monitoring expense. If you really want to self-monitor, terrific. But if you're simply fretted about the cost, we suggest checking out low-priced professional monitoring plans like SimpliSafe's or Scout Alarm's.</p>
