Image quality is excellent both during the day and night, and the motion tracking (which focuses and follows motion) and facial acknowledgment (which just notifies you to unknown faces) are extremely beneficial functions which actually work.</p>

<h4>Home Protection Systems Byron 31008</h4>
<p>I have this camera connected to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, but you'll pay a little more if you want to add additional functions, like a security camera. While a typical contract runs 42 months (among the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who wish to lease their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum contract requirement.</p>
