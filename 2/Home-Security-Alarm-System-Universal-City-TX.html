No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
