In theory the rubberised magnetic dish on the back, paired with a rough-textured metal ball installed on the wall, would be a outstanding and definitely adjustable  mount, but in practice it's slippery and the magnetic connection isn't rather strong enough to hold the weight of the camera and its internal battery in a fixed position.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it's difficult to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the cost. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically 2 years of usage, day and night images have constantly been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we experienced when testing the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion identified.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

We believe that's pricey.</p>
