No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night.
