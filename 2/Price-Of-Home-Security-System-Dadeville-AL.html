<p>While every house owner frets about burglaries, apprehension has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high expenses, complicated contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often leading to incorrect alarms. Nearly 100 surveillance cameras-- 24 PTZ cameras, 17 dome cameras, and 54 license recognition cameras are being set up on 64 power poles in Birmingham, Alabama. The cameras will be monitored by the Jefferson County Metro Area Criminal activity Center The license plate recognition camera information will be published to the FBI's Wrongdoer Justice Info Services, and the city will get the content from the FBI's website. Although a proposed regulation needing all facilities with liquor licenses to install cameras that feed into the monitoring center was abandoned in the face of opposition, several bars accused of breaching liquor laws have entered approval decrees with the city's Liquor Control board, needing them to do simply that.</p>
<p>Commercial residential or commercial properties tend to have even higher false alarm rates than residential properties since more individuals tend to share duty for triggering and deactivating the alarm systems, and the systems tend to be more complicated.
