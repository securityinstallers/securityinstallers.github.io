<h3>CCTV Installation - How to Secure an IP Security Camera in Chalmette</h3>

<h4>Alarm House System Chalmette 70043</h4>
<p>On the installation date, a single specialist showed up surprisingly early-- at 8 a.m.-- instead of the 10 a.m.-noon window that had been agreed upon. Likewise upsetting was the truth that he had no ADT logo design on his shirt and did not speak a word of English. I called ADT right away and the company acknowledged it had made a mistake. A manager would return later on with another installation subcontractor who would be much better able to communicate, I was informed. The manager arrived at 10:30 with two other men who spoke little English. In reaction to my concerns, I was guaranteed that these subcontractors, while not ADT staff members, had actually just recently gone through comprehensive background checks. When the guys left after six hours, the installation work still had not been completed. Following additional complaints, 2 weeks later on a new specialist was sent who indicated there would be substantial service charges to complete the installation.</p>
