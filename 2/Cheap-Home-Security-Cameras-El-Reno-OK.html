<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some parts might be impacted temporarily by a power outage, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electricity. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours till the electric service is restored. Landline systems use traditional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, similar to cellular systems, they usually have a battery backup to keep them working for a set period of time.</p>
