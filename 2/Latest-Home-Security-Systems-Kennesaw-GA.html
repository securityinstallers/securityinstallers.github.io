<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone device or in tandem with the rest of your security system. When somebody rings the doorbell, it triggers the doorbell camera.

These cameras often come with two-way talk, night vision, and an integrated motion sensing unit. Similar to any security camera, have a look at the video resolution and field of view.

<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Really annoying. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, because obviously they car restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.
