I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall.
