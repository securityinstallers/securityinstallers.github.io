<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is vital.

Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to compare an automobile and an individual, for instance, permits you to minimize unnecessary signals.

<p>The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter informs, for instance. Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively steep cost: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 annually) for 1 month of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the initial fee.
