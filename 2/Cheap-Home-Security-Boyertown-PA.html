Some might have a serial port for connection to a specialist's computer system for diagnostics. These are the true heart of the system.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and for that reason provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
