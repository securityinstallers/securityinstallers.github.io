<p>With an analog system, coax cable is required for sending video footage from the CCTV security cameras. This is one of the drawbacks of analog CCTV video surveillance, as the cable television can be tough and pricey to install, particularly for bigger camera networks, and those were cameras should be positioned in difficult locations. When consumers buy one of ADT's security packages, the company sends an authorized service technician with approximately 11 years experience to assess the home and install the equipment.

Lots of insurance companies use discounts on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments provide numerous "complimentary" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is considerable right from the start. The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the present pattern in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or 4 totally free false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
