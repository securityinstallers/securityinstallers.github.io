<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. While some elements might be impacted for a moment by a power interruption, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electricity. Cellular systems use cell towers to interact with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for numerous hours till the electrical service is brought back. Landline systems utilize conventional phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, much like cellular systems, they normally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level.
