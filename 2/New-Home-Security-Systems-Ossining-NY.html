<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and for that reason provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Bullet cameras are quickly mountable and can work inside or outdoors. They feature a small lip on completion of the camera that adds weather condition protection and reduces glare.</p>
