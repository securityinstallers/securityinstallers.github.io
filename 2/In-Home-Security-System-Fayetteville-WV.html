<p>Brinks has quite basic equipment, but we love its smart monitoring alerts. Vivint has a credibility for innovative home security services, and the Ping Indoor Camera does not dissatisfy. Plus, SimpliSafe is adept on the equipment front. You can find everything from window sensors to leakage detectors to carbon monoxide sensing units.
