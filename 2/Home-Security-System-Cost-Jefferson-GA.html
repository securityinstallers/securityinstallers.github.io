<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
