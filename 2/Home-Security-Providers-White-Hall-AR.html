I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night.
