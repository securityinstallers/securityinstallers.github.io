<p>The very first (and most apparent, for sure) component of a CCTV system are the security cameras. Which security cameras are ideal for your system depends upon your private needs and budget plan; are you positioning them inside or outdoors? Is 1080P a large sufficient resolution?

That equipment is spent for within the very first year, however do they lower your rate once it's settled? No. You're stuck at that $60-$ 70 monthly rate for a minimum of another 2+ years.
